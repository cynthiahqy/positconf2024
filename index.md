abstract: >
  Have you ever considered using the power and flexibility of Quarto for
  note-taking and knowledge management? I did, and now I use Quarto websites to
  track my PhD progress, document insights from conferences, manage
  collaborative research projects, and more. Let me show you how easy it is to
  implement standard knowledge management system features, such as
  cross-referencing, search indexing, and custom navigation. But what if you
  want more advanced features like glossaries, document listings and summaries
  of datasets? Well, with some creative use of Quarto's many features and
  extensions, almost anything is possible. Whether you're new to Quarto or a
  seasoned expert, consider adding Quarto to your note-taking toolkit.
